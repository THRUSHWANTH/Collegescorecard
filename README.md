Regression Problem
Currently I am trying to apply different machine learning and deep learning model for predicting the graduation completion rate of bachelors in all the colleges listed in this data. After merging data of about 20 years, there are around 3200 columns.
I am working on cleaning the data and building machine learning models first and then deep learning models later. 

Do checkout every week to know update on my work.
