Regression Problem
I am trying to apply different machine learning and deep learning model for predicting the graduation completion rate of bachelors in all the colleges listed in this data. This data has around 3400 columns and 6000 rows.
I am working on cleaning the data and building machine learning models first and then deep learning models later.
