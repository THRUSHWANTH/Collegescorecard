# College Graduation Rate Prediction Project

## Overview
Welcome to the College Graduation Rate Prediction Project. This project is focused on applying various machine learning and deep learning models to predict the graduation completion rates of bachelor's degree programs across colleges in the United States. The analysis is based on data sourced from the College Scorecard.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast the graduation rates of colleges, utilizing a comprehensive dataset that spans approximately 20 years.

## Data Sources
- **College Scorecard Website:** [https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)
- **Data Page:** [https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data)
- **Documentation:** [View Documentation](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/assets/InstitutionDataDocumentation.pdf)
- **Dataset Download:** [CollegeScorecard Raw Data (04/19/2023)](https://ed-public-download.app.cloud.gov/downloads/CollegeScorecard_Raw_Data_04192023.zip)

## Project Description
### Data Preprocessing
The dataset comprises data from over 20 years, resulting in approximately 3200 columns. A significant aspect of this project is cleaning and preprocessing this extensive data to make it suitable for predictive modeling.

### Modeling Approach
- **Phase 1: Machine Learning Models**
  - Initial modeling is being done using various machine learning techniques.
  - Models include [Linear Regression,polynomial Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagged Regressor, Xgboost etc.].

- **Phase 2: Deep Learning Models**
  - Following machine learning, deep learning models will be employed to enhance prediction accuracy.
  - Models will include [RNN, LSTM, Transfer learning].

## Progress Updates
I am actively working on this project, and updates will be posted here regularly. Be sure to check back every week to stay informed about the latest developments!

### Current Status
- Data cleaning and initial preprocessing are underway.
- Initial machine learning models are being tested and evaluated.
